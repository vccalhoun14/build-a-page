  <!--I decided to use normalize.css as my reset because I was a little more familiar with it. Before this class I had been introduced to normalize.css through a Treehouse project. After reading what Jonathan (Snooki) had to say about it, my preference was reinforced. He did, however, suggest that a developer should create his/her own set of reset css to fit personalized needs. At some point, when I have more experience, I would like to do that!-->
